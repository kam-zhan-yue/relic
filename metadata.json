  "gameBlurb": "Relic is a third person, angled top-down puzzle game based around perception, light and memory. The player must navigate through a series of levels, interacting with objects such as switches, buttons and levers. The main mechanic of the game is a system in which objects that are no longer observed by a light source leave an imprint of their last seen location. However the real object can still move around without being observed by the player.",
